In Curtorim's embrace, where palm trees sway,
Whispers of the past in the air, they play.
In Goa's heart, a gem of rich lore,
Curtorim's essence, forever to adore.

Amidst verdant fields and rivers that gleam,
Curtorim's charm, like a vivid dream.
Mango groves dance in the golden light,
Painting a canvas of pure delight.

In quaint streets, stories old and new,
Echoes of joy, tales woven true.
From ancient temples to churches grand,
Curtorim's heritage, a treasure trove of land.

The aroma of spices, the taste of the sea,
In Curtorim's essence, souls wander free.
With every sunset, a serenade divine,
In Curtorim's embrace, hearts intertwine.

Oh, Curtorim, in Goa's gentle embrace,
Your beauty and grace, time cannot erase.
Forever etched in memories, a timeless glow,
Curtorim's spirit, in poetry, will forever flow.
Hello World
Have a wonderful day!
