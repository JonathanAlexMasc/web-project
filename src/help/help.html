            <h3>Name - Jonathan Mascarenhas</h3>
            <h3>Course - CSC 468. Section - M01</h3>
            <h3>
                The custom cat tree creator is a web application that uses HTML, CSS,
                JavaScript, nodeJS along with a couple of other third party libraries such as
                formidable, express, mustache, etc.
                It consists of two main features - the main page and the file management page,
                both of which are described below.
            </h3>
            <h3>The Main Page</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Buttons</b>
                <li>Change Component - This rotates an element between House, Pole, and Empty.</li>
                <li>Add Row - Adds a row of three empty elements.</li>
                <li>Reset - Changes the content to its default setting of three Empty elements.</li>
                <li>All Poles - Resets the content and converts the first two rows to all poles.</li>
                <li>Undo - Undoes the state to its former state.</li>
                <li>Redo - Redoes the state if an undo previously took place.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                Below the buttons we have the elements that make up the custom cat tree, and these elements are
                encompassed by a border that grows and shrinks with the size of the elements inside it. These elements
                all make up the main content/the tree itself.
            </p>

            <h3>The File Management Page</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Buttons</b>
                <li>Change Component - This rotates an element between House, Pole, and Empty.</li>
                <li>Add Row - Adds a row of three empty elements.</li>
                <li>Reset - Changes the content to its default setting of three Empty elements.</li>
                <li>All Poles - Resets the content and converts the first two rows to all poles.</li>
                <li>Undo - Undoes the state to its former state.</li>
                <li>Redo - Redoes the state if an undo previously took place.</li>

            <h2>Checklist</h2>
            <p>
                I will have submitted my checklist as a text file to the project dropbox. Please check it for the render URL.

        <section id="css-modifications">
            <h2>CSS Modifications</h2>
            <li><b>Background</b> - Have a background color of light olive on all of my pages that is not white. This can be verified visually.</li>
            <li><a href="../index.html#requirement2"><b>Custom CSS header</b></a> - There is a custom CSS header in all pages.</li>
            <li><a href="../index.html#requirement3"><b>Background color rule on navbar</b></a> - Dark grey background on the navbar.</li>
            <li><b>Custom 'a' tag rule</b> - There is a custom a tag rule that converts links to blue on hover. This can be verified by hovering over links
            in the navbar as in this section links overridden due to white background.</li>
            <li><a href="../main/main.html#main-content"><b>Border</b></a> - Yes there is a border that expands and shrinks with main content.</li>

            <h2>Program Usage</h2>
            <p>
                I don't believe I have any bugs to report, as for the use of my program, it is
                intuitive and tries to follow the requirements for this project as closely as possible.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Note</b> :  have used GitHub instead of GitLab due to an authentication issue, for which I have received
                a tentative ok from Dr. Rebenitsch. I aim to fix this issue post finishing my project submission
                if I am not able to before.
