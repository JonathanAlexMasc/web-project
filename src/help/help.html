            <h2>Description</h2>
            <h3>Name - Jonathan Mascarenhas</h3>
            <h3>Course - CSC 468. Section - M01</h3>
            <h3>
                The custom cat tree creator is a web application that uses HTML, CSS,
                JavaScript, nodeJS along with a couple of other third party libraries such as
                formidable, express, mustache, etc.
                It consists of two main features - the main page and the file management page,
                both of which are described below.
            </h3>
            <h3>The Main Page</h3>
            <b>Buttons</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Change Component - This rotates an element between House, Pole, and Empty.</li>
                <li>Add Row - Adds a row of three empty elements.</li>
                <li>Reset - Changes the content to its default setting of three Empty elements.</li>
                <li>All Poles - Resets the content and converts the first two rows to all poles.</li>
                <li>Undo - Undoes the state to its former state.</li>
                <li>Redo - Redoes the state if an undo previously took place.</li>
                <li>Save - Saves the main content to server. Does not save Undo/Redo history.</li>
                <li>Delete - Deletes the last row in main content.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Below the buttons we have the elements that make up the custom cat tree, and these elements are
                encompassed by a border that grows and shrinks with the size of the elements inside it. These elements
                all make up the main content/the tree itself.
            </p>

            <h3>The File Management Page</h3>

            <b>Buttons</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose File - Let's you choose a file to upload.</li>
                <li>Submit - Submit the file to the server.</li>
                <li>Load - Load the contents of the file into the file management page.</li>
                <li>Download - Download the file to your local machine.</li>
                <li>Append - Appends some text to the end of the file.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                There is a box below the buttons that displays the content to the user when they click on load.
            </p>

                a tentative ok from Dr. Rebenitsch. I aim to fix this issue post finishing my project submission
                if I am not able to before.
